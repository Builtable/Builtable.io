Have you ever thought of giving someone customized chocolates? Well, John Tan, inventor of Vaquform, can show you how to do it! With just the use of clay, plastic sheets (food grade) and vacuum forming, people were able to make their own chocolate mold in a matter of seconds!

Here's a sample of the actual mold that one of the participants made! Someone can now make leaves-shaped chocolates wherever, whenever!

This may look futuristic and high-tech, but according to John, the technology has been there ever since! He just shrunk the clunky machine to be more sleek and compact, making vaquform useful and stylish at the same time!
