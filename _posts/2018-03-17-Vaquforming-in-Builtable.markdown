Have you ever thought of giving someone customized chocolates? Well, John Tan, inventor of Vaquform, can show you how to do it! Just by using only clay, some plastic sheets (food grade) and vacuum forming, people were able to make their own chocolate mold in a matter of seconds!

Here's a sample of the actual mold that one of the participants made! Someone's gonna make chocolate-shaped leaves tonight!

This may look futuristic and high-tech, but according to John, the technology has been there eversince! He just revolutionized by shrinking those big machines into a desktop size!
