Have you ever imagine of having a bag that has your signature on it? Let Cindel & Abby of HOLY CRAFT! Studios guide you in making one through this hand-made leather bag workshop! Learn to design & make your very own Leather Carry-all Bag & Bag Ornament for yourself or someone!

**Add-ons: (Until July 18)**
- Basic Leather Tool Kit: 1500php
- Deluxe Leather Tool Kit: 3500php

**KIT INCLUSIONS**
Leather/ Magnetic Snaps/ Rivets/ Tote Bag Pattern/ Making Guide & Instructions

** STRICTLY should be in the event by 1:00 PM the LATEST.

** Participants can bring aprons or gloves if they don't want to get their clothes and hands dirty. 

Otherwise come in work clothes. (The burnishing and edge dyeing process as well as glueing can get a bit messy.)
